# Day 17

**Activity1**

<br>

1. Implement a node class to represent an element in a linked list with properties value and next.

2. Implement a LinkedList class with methods to add a node to the end , remove a node from the end and display all nodes

<br>

**Activity2**
<br>

1. Implement a stack class with methods push(add element) , pop (remove element) and peek(view the top element).

2. Use the stack class to reverse a string by pushing all characters onto the stack and then popping them off .

<br>

**Activity3**

<br>

1. Implement a Queue class with methods , Enqueue (add elememt) , dequeue(remove element) and front(view the first element)
2. Use the Queue class to simulate a simple printer queue where print jobs are added to the queue and processed in order.

<br>

**Activity4**

<br>

1. Implement a TreeNode class to represent a node in a binary tree with properties value, left and right
2. Implement a BinaryTree class with methods for inserting values and performing in-order traversal to display nodes.

<br>

**Activity5**
<br>

1. Implement a Graph class with methods to add verices, add edges and perform a breadth-first search(BFS)
2. Use the graph clas to represent a simple network and perform BFS to find the shortest path between two nodes.
